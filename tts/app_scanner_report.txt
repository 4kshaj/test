After the scanning is completed, the user is provided with links to view the sitemap and HTML report.
The sitemap is an interactive visualisation.
Each screen is represented by nodes, and each action is represented by arrows.
You can hover on nodes to view to display the screen image, and click on them to expand or collapse the screens that are accessible from it.

The report shows if there are any broken images in any screens.
It also shows which CTAs or links lead to error screens, and what exactly the error was.

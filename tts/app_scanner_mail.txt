This is a sample e-mail that the user will receive.
It contains 2 items - the link to browserstack execution, and the live logs of what the app scanner is doing.

The execution URL takes us to browserstack, where we can view the app scanner code getting executed.


As you can see, each interaction step performed by the app scanner gets documented here.


The LOGS link takes us to the logs of which step is currently getting executed from the app scanner's perspective.


This gets updated live and is crucial for analysing issues.

Similar to  the native app, we will receive an email with the browserstack URL and logs for the web platform.

The scanning for web executes similar to native.
